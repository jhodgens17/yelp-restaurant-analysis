# Reviewing Yelp data to inform decision on opening a restaurant in Long Beach Island, NJ

The purpose of this project was to use exploratory data analysis to generate insights regarding opening a restaurant in the Long Beach Island area located on the Jersey Shore. Data obtained from Yelp's API was leveraged to conduct the analysis. The primary objective was to answer two questions - 1) Where specifically in the LBI region should the restaurant be located? and 2) What type of restaurant should it be (i.e. what category of cuisine)?

### Notes

- The visualizations in the notebook use best practices for visualization that you should try to emulate. For example, they have clear axes, descriptive titles, and appropriate number formatting
- The `dsc-phase1-project-template.ipynb` is intended to be the _final version_ of your project. The first notebook you create will not look like this. You are encouraged to start with a very disorderly notebook and clean it as you go
