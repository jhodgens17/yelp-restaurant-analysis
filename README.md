# Reviewing Yelp data to inform decision on opening a restaurant in Long Beach Island, NJ

The purpose of this project was to use exploratory data analysis to generate insights regarding opening a restaurant in the Long Beach Island area located on the Jersey Shore. Data obtained from Yelp's API was leveraged to conduct the analysis. The primary objective was to answer two questions - 1) Where specifically in the LBI region should the restaurant be located? and 2) What type of restaurant should it be (i.e. what category of cuisine)?

## Summary of analysis
Yelp data was reviewed for existing restaurants in the LBI region including the:
- Ratings
- Number of reviews
- Restaurant categories
- Locations

Based on athe anlaysis conducted in this exercise, there is an opportunity to open a sushi restaurant in the mainland region west of Long Beach Island or on the southern part of the island.

Two-hundred restaurants in the LBI region were analyzed as part of this exercise:

1. Seafood
